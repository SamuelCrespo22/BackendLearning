# Python Foundations - BackendLearning - Week 1

This Repository contains foundational Python scripts that I wrote during the first week of my backend engineering preparation.

## Contains:

- `calculator.py`: CLI calculator using functions.
- `fibonacci.py`: Module containing a function that calculates the nth fibonacci number.
- `student_grades.py`: Script using dictionaries to manage student records
- `greetings_writer.py`: Reads a text file and writes personalized greetings
- `oop_students.py`: Simple OOP example with classes and inheritance
- `exercises/`: Smaller scripts and practice tasks
- `notes/week1_review.md`: My reflections on what I learned

## Why This Repo?

I'm transitioning from biomedical engineering to software engineering and preparing for a Master's in Informatics Engineering. This repository documents my early progress in Python and software development.
